    <p class="tbody">when continents split a fault line forms Kallie is in her sophomore year at Polaris. She moved here in the middle of 8th grade and started making new friends. Things changed, but Kallie persevered. As the family stumbled along, conflicts began to occur, and tension in the family, began to build, but her brothers protected her and her siblings from the fights. When she was 11 years old, her parents got divorced, and the world turned upside down, well split in half. In the chaos, things crumbled.<br> “There is no death, only a change of worlds.”<br>-Chief Seattle<br> Things changed again, and not for the better. It was like another move every week. She had to pack up, say goodbye, and move worlds, each, week.As the split took place her parents became more divided, the climate changed, and Kallie had to adapt. It's as if each house had different laws of physics, and Kallie had to figure them out. Nothing She knew about her parents still applied here, nothing but their names. After the bombshells fell, things started to look up.The dust settled and the blaze flamed out. After the fuel burned things calmed down. She started to settle into this new way of life. As she often does, Kallie got through it and came out stronger.<br> “We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”<br>-Winston Churchill</p>
