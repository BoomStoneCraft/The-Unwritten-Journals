        <h1 class="nbody" style="top:123px;"><br>The lazorus group</h1>
        <div class="nbackground">    The Lazarus group is North Korea’s hackers. They are deployed whenever Kim Jong-un wants something, In this story, it is money, but this group has done much more. </div>

        <h1 class="nbody" style="top:128px"><br>The Entry Point</h1>
        <div class="nbackground">it starts easy, nothing serious. something you could do in your basement. A new job applicant sends in a resommay and a virus. and a employ falls for it hook line and sinker</div>
    
        <h1 class="nbody" style="top:128px"><br>The Tracks</h1>
        <div class="nbackground">    Once they were in they moved into position. and disabled the logging of transactions. there was only one problem, the printer. it kept track of every transaction but was put out of commission.</div>
    
        <h1 class="nbody" style="top:128px"><br>The Plan</h1>
        <div class="nbackground">When the time came the Lazorus group made a transaction from the bank’s FRB account. to the philippines. the bank was on the weekend and when they came back the FRB would be, and after that, the philippines would be on holiday.</div>
    
        <h1 class="nbody" style="top:128px"><br>The Stop</h1>
        <div class="nbackground">the only reason that this hack was stopped was because the hackers choice a bank with Jupiter in it’s name. this just so happens to be the name of a sanctioned Iranian boat. this word set off the alarm and sent most of the transitions to revue.</div>
    
        <h1 class="nbody" style="top:128px"><br>The Impact</h1>
        <div class="nbackground">Although most of the billion dollars were stopped 18 million got through to the hackers. the worst part is that this was not from a wealthy CEO or company, this money was the government of Bangladesh’s funds, and they needed them. 18 million dollars could have done a lot of good but is now in the hands of North Korea</div>
