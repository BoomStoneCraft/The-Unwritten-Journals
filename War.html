            <h1 class="Wbody">The Problem Paragraph</h1>
            <p class="Wbody">   The topic that I will discuss, with myself, in the void today is nation-state hacking with political motives. The truth of the matter is that most nations are hacking into, most other nations to gain information about their power and information that they then use as political power over those nations. For example, Iran was using WhatsApp to try and plant malware on US political figures. Had it worked, it would allow the Iranian government to see into the phones of US officials, so think of things like texts, emails, 2-step verification, photos, cloud storage, call history, bank details, and more. This could lead to a lot of information falling into the hands of the Iranian government, So you can see why this would be appealing to global powers. Now before I go further I would like to mention the difficulty of studying this topic. All of what I will discuss here is operations carried out in a lot of secrecy, so It is very hard to know exactly what happened, why it happened, or who did it. Most of the hacks we have a good idea about are only because things went wrong. Now that said, all the events I will refer to have been accepted as fact among the people much smarter than me who investigate these things.<br></p>
            <h1 class="Wbody"><br>The dynamic power in these power dynamics</h1>
            <p class="Wbody">	As mentioned above a lot of important political information can be acquired through hacking and this information holds a lot of power so I would like to break down these dynamics to make them a bit easier to understand. So one government, let's call it Logineienstan, is sending a bunch of fake emails from the postal service in the target country to important political figures there talking about some packages that failed to deliver. Let's say the monarch clicks the like and gets sent to a web page controlled by Logineienstan. The Logineiens can now use some tools to get a reverse shell, now what a reverse shell does is get the target computer to connect back to the attackers' computer this will bypass any firewalls. So the king of my target countries’ computer is now connected to my computer where I can send code right to their computer and it will execute it. This can allow me to get all sorts of information from their computer. I can now steal their informational power and use it myself. Let’s say I find some documents about a planned attack on a neighboring nation. Now, we all know how blackmail works so that is one way to leverage this informational power into political power but there are other ways. Maybe I will attack that nation while they're attacking the other nation, or tip off that nation to the attack so we can set a trap. Maybe that attack plan mentions some specific infrastructure they will use that I can attack digitally to disrupt their attack. I could even find information that could allow for future cyber attacks like usernames and passwords. Now here is the big question: if I get caught hacking this contrite what repercussions should I see? Should It be a War crime? Should it be an act of war? Should it be forgiven? This is the dilemma, right now world powers are attacking each other over the internet they are stealing millions of dollars in information and using it to grow their power. Some nations are even attacking the power grid of others(<i>cough cough</i> <b>RUSSA</b> <i>cough cough</i>) this has become a large problem in Ukraine as Russia has been launching cyber attack after cyber attack most of which have been having large effects on the civilians. Now at the moment, Russia denies launching these attacks and claims it is just civilians acting of their own free will so Russia has gotten off scuff-free.</p>
            <h1 class="Wbody"><br>Heterogeneous solutions</h1>
            <p class="Wbody">	When writing this, most countries like the solution “Well if we hack them first then they can’t hack us”. In my opinion, this is bogus. Now I don’t know of a “good” solution but I will present a few I have found. Firstly there is the solution to make it an act of war, if you hack us then you must be declaring war, now this will lead to a lot of conflict as I would bet that most governments would take the gamble in exchange for more information. Another solution is to keep this important data offline, this would make it impossible to use hacking to obtain information, but it would be a massive headache to work with this information. With the current speed at which secret information is made,  accessed, and moved, I think that it would be unrealistic to try and move everything offline. One solution is cryptography which works but is not perfect, cryptography is the process of using mathematical algorithms to scramble the information into unreadable nothing. The only problem I see with this is that if there's a way to read it there's a way to break the code. Right now cryptography is in full use but is not effective enough to stop all of the attacks. Cryptography is currently under development by every government and a lot of independent researchers so it will improve, but between the code breakers and code makers there exists a very long game of cat and mouse. Now the solution that I think has the best chance of working is cryptography but it will never be perfect and I think that these hacks will just become routine informational gathering.</p>
