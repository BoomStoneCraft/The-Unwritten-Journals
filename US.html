        <h1 class="Uheader">The U.S. Compared <br> to Rome's Fall</h1>
        <p id="space" style="position:relative;"></p>
        <p class="Ubody">Rome died a death of a thousand cuts, and some of these larger cuts I will discuss here. The first that I will speak on is the Goths. The Goths were being pushed out of their territory by the huns and fled to Rome (3). Rome ignored the issue, so the border was unsure whether to attack or welcome the Goths (2). Eventually, the Goths started spreading throughout Rome.  As the Goths poured in, they weakened the insecure border, leading to Rome slowly losing territory, meaning fewer people and fewer military recruits. Now, when a whole group of people in your city aren’t really citizens, they tend not to like you. This had a large political impact because a large part of the Roman population was now not really allowed to be in Rome, but also not, not allowed to be there.</p>
        <p class="Ubody">Political instability certainly played its part in the fall of Rome. As the Emperor's changes vary frequently (6) and most emperors had different ideas about how the empire should work, combined with its size, policy changes vary fast, and it took months for the border to know what had happened. This caused chaos and disorder throughout the empire, leading to a seizure of sorts. At its worst, you might hear that an issue was being addressed in x way, but it had already changed to being addressed in y way. Naturally, this led to turmoil as the empire struggled to keep up with the emperors. This instability sometimes leads to multiple people trying to be emperor.  Now in Rome, a new emperor was to be decided by who had the support of the military, which had no unintended side effects. Some of these intended effects were that someone who was a good general could be emperor, someone who said they would pay the military more could be emperor, if the military disagreed, then a civil war would choose the next leader. This led to the emperors trying their best to get the military’s support and dividing the military into two sides. When the military was divided, its organisation broke down and sometimes turned into warring factions.</p>
        <p class="Ubody">Now for America’s turn. In the modern us, instead of goths entering our borders, we have immigrants entering our borders. Now, thankfully, we have not decided to ignore this issue, but instead, we have two parties who have opposite approaches to immigration struggling to impose their beliefs of immigration on America. This is not quite as bad because we have the internet, so policy changes spread quickly, but we still do a 180 on immigration every 4 years. Now, fortunately, the us isn’t at war right now, and the immigrants aren’t going to break down our border, but this still has big political implications because about half of America wants to strictly defend the border (7), and the other half wants to embrace the immigrants with open arms (8).</p>
        <p class="Ubody">Speaking of those parties, much like Rome, the US changes leaders often. We get a new president every 4 years, but in the us, these leaders belong to one of two parties: democrats and republicans. These parties usually can mostly agree on what should happen, although recently these parties have separated more and more. These parties have been struggling for votes and have landed in a deadlock. In a deadlock like this, only a few people can decide the outcome of an election. This leads to a lot of volatility when a few people control the election, and both parties think the others are lunatics. This can feel much like Rome's two warring factions over the next emperor.</p>
        <p class="Ubody">Now, the majority of this obscurity comes from a lack of communication, especially in the U.S. What America needs instead of warring parties is two different government options. People on both sides need to speak to each other and stay informed. Democracy only works if all the voters know what they are voting on. So both sides need to try their best to know all sides of all candidates. My advice to the government is to punish misinformation in the government. This would incentivise honesty and understanding of the topics that politicians speak on. This would be difficult and resource-intensive to implement, but if done properly, shift the burden of fact-checking off the people onto the parties themselves.</p>
