    <p class="cbody">YOU ARE KILLING OUR EARTH RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHERS BUT YOU ARE DOING A SMALL AMOUNT TO KILL THE PLANET. I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT RELATES TO IT. IF I AM CORRECT YOU ARE BREATHING, AND THEREFORE KILLING OUR EARTH. GLOBAL TEMPERATURES  HAVE RISEN BY 1.183 DEGREES CELSIUS SINCE 1977. THIS MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IT HAS BEEN ENOUGH TO REK HAVOC. FOR EXAMPLE. A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT MOSSES, ALONG WITH SOME LICHEN, LIVERWORTS, AND ASSOCIATED ALGAE, HAVE COLONIZED MORE THAN 4.6 SQUARE MILES. THIS IS WHAT 1.183 DEGREES CAN DO AND IT GOES FARTHER THAN THAT. IN 2020 THERE WERE 22 NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE US AND OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE U.S. HAS EXPERIENCED AN AVERAGE OF 18 BILLION-DOLLAR NATURAL DISASTERS PER YEAR. THAT IS ENOUGH TO SUPPORT 2,795,031 FAMILIES IN THE US. THESE DISASTERS CAUSED 38059 DEATHS WORLDWIDE IN 2023.  THIS IS A PROBLEM AND IT NEEDS FIXING. IF WE DO NOTHING THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE TIME FOR WHATEVER ELSE IS MORE IMPORTANT.</p>
