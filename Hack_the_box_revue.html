        <p><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/">THE HACK THE BOX ACADEMY</a> IS A FREE ONLINE COURSE THAT TEACHES YOU ABOUT THE IT FIELD, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HACKING. IT IS A GREAT INTRODUCTORY COURSE THAT I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO TAKE FOR A WHILE. ALTHOUGH I DIDN’T FINISH THE COURSE, FROM WHAT I EXPERIENCED IT WAS A LOT OF READING. THE COURSE HAD A FUN INTERACTIVE ELEMENT AT THE END OF EACH LESSON THAT WOULD MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE TOPIC. FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN THERE ARE ACTIVE HACKING SEGMENTS A LITTLE BIT INTO THE COURSE. I REALLY ENJOYED THE INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE ON WITH THIS COURSE IN MY FREE TIME. I THINK THAT IT IS MORE GEARED TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT JUST INTERESTED IN THE IT AND HACKING FIELDS, BUT WHO ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GROWING IN THEM. THERE ARE FUN AND LESS ACADEMIC SEGMENTS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE COURSE IS READING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT READING. I WOULD LIKE MORE VISUAL ELEMENTS ADDED TO THE COURSE BUT OVERALL I REALLY ENJOYED MY EXPERIENCE AND WILL CONTINUE ON WITH THESE COURSES IN MY FREE TIME TO BETTER MYSELF. I WOULD RATE THIS COURSE 4 OUT OF 5 STARS, IT DIDN’T BLOW ME AWAY BUT IT WAS A WELL-PLANNED AND QUITE INFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE, AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE IT IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING A CAREER IN IT.</p>
